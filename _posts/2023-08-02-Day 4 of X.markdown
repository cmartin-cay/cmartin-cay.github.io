**Goal**  
No coding today. At least nothing intentional. Today is about getting a spare laptop up and running with a pi-hole, getting plex set up on the system to act as a media server, and setting up some type of remote desktop access.

This should be head bangingly hard as the laptop is running Linux, and the other machines are Windows and Mac. So, I really am the most OS indifferent person out there.

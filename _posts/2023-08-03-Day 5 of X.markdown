**Problem**  
So what's next. My concern with X days of Code was that I wouldn't find anything that I was excited to work on. Or something that would take up enough time and pose interesting problems.

Most of what I use python for is solving problems in my day to day life, in particular problems cause by work. But I'm not working. Which means I don't really have very many day to day problems. You see the problem.

**Plan**  
So what to do . Ok, there's a few things. First, and it's a silly project that is retreading old ground. But I'm going to update my timesheet program to use textual and mongodb.
And rather than pandas, I'll break out polars to see how well it can read from a database and do some simple data manipulation and groupby / pivot table stuff. I also need it to export to excel so we can find out if that works

**First Step**  
Textual has some tutorials on design and also has a sample project with a stopwatch which can easily be copied and modified. That's my goal for Day 6. To get a layout coded up and the front end working nicely

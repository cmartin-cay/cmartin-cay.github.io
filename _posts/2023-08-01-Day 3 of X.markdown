**Goal**  
Just messing around with some plots to try and get something resembling a polar chart. This is going to get done in Jupyter labs

It's trickier than you'd think to get matplotlib to make a polar chart with anything that isn't shown as a 360<sup>o</sup> circle. Maybe it's got something to do with the axes labels.

Nuts to `matplotlib` I never liked it anyway.

**Plotly**  
Something different. Lets see. No that sucked. New plan. Back to `matplotlib`. It's fine. Never had anything against it. I wonder how you change the value of the axes labels. Which, is where I was about 30 minutes ago

**Failure**  
Ok. I give up. The charting element of this is going to defeat me. Charts are annoyingly hard. 
But over all I learned a few things about xml and some tools to convert an xml api feed into pydantic and to work with it. So, a failure on my original plan but not a complete failure.

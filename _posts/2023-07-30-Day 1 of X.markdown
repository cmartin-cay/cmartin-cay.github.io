**Goal**
Something simple and silly. Get the Irish Lotto results, put them into a histogram and take a look at some data that won't be of any use. So 

```python
pip install pandas jupyterlab
```

**First Step**
Get some date. Well it turns out that finding data for the Lotto results is much trickier than I expected. An inauspicious start.	

Progress? I've found an undocumented api. An api can only mean one thing
```python
pip install pydantic requests
```
Two things, I'd forgotten about the excellent https://jsontopydantic.com/ ......oh god it comes back as XML. XML??? Really? Can pydantic deal with xml? Ok that was a rabbit hole. Let's try
```python
pip install xmltodict
```
Ok, borrowing/stealing some sample code and feeding it to the website does give me some json that can be converted to pydantic. I think we're ready for

**Second Step**
This is the do something useful step of the process. Ok, I have the results for one draw put into a pydantic model. Umm, that's something kind of useful?
```python
r = requests.get(request_body)  
parsed_xml = xmltodict.parse(r.text)  
draw_result = LottoModel(**parsed_xml)
```
And then just to get something a little useful for the start of today, lets take a look at the 6 winning numbers and the bonus (not sure how to display results just yet, so take my word for it that this does work, clumsy though it may look)
```python
results = [elem.Number for elem in draw_result.ArrayOfDrawResult.DrawResult.Numbers.DrawNumber]
```

Lets start working on this new timesheet app. First up, `pip install textual-dev` Let's get some kind of a layout sorted out

Ok that's rubbish, but it will work for now

**Build it**  
Ok - off to Textual to work out how on earth to even create this.

Well, some of it is built. It's a basis with some of the stuff I need. It's good enough for today
